AKAMAI SECURITY RESEARCH: FINANCIAL SERVICES CONTINUES GETTING BOMBARDED WITH CREDENTIAL STUFFING AND WEB APPLICATION ATTACKS
May 19, 2021 at 6:30 AM EDT
Akamai and WMC researchers scrutinized multiple phishing kits including 'Kr3pto,' which has targeted customers of 11 UK banking brands
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 19, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKAM), the world's most trusted solution for protecting and delivering digital experiences, today published the State of the Internet / Security report: Phishing for Finance. The report provides an analysis of both global and financial services-specific web application and credential stuffing attack traffic -- revealing significant increases across the attack surfaces year over year from 2019 to 2020.

The report also features a collaboration between Akamai and WMC Global researchers that examined two specific phishing kits: 'Kr3pto' and 'Ex-Robotos'. Kr3pto has targeted customers of 11 UK banking brands, and Ex-Robotos has aimed its scams at corporate employees.

By The Numbers

In 2020, Akamai saw 193 billion credential stuffing attacks globally, with 3.4 billion hitting financial services organizations specifically -- an increase of more than 45% year-over-year in the sector.

Akamai observed nearly 6.3 billion web application attacks in 2020, with more than 736 million targeting financial services -- which represents an increase of 62% from 2019.

SQL Injection (SQLi) attacks remained in the top spot across all business types globally, making up 68% of all web application attacks in 2020, with Local File Inclusion (LFI) attacks coming in second at 22%. However, in the financial services industry, LFI attacks were the number one web application attack type in 2020 at 52%, with SQLi at 33% and Cross-Site Scripting at 9%.

Over the past three years (2018-2020), Akamai saw DDoS attacks against the financial services sector grow by 93%, indicating that systemic disruption remains an objective for criminals, who target services and applications required for daily business.

Threat Intelligence Collaboration

For this report, Akamai partnered with threat intelligence company WMC Global. The researchers at WMC Global are experts at understanding SMS phishing (smishing) and the toolkits that criminals devise to make their attacks possible. This unique collaboration examined two specific phishing kits: 'Kr3pto' and 'Ex-Robotos'.

"The ongoing, significant growth in credential stuffing attacks has a direct relationship to the state of phishing in the financial services industry," said Steve Ragan, Akamai security researcher and author of the State of the Internet / Security report. "Criminals use a variety of methods to augment their credential collections, and phishing is one of the key tools in their arsenal. By targeting banking customers and employees in the sector, criminals increase their pool of potential victims exponentially."

The Kr3pto phishing kit, which targets financial institutions and their customers via SMS, has been observed spoofing 11 brands in the UK, across more than 8,000 domains since May 2020. WMC Global tracked more than 4,000 campaigns linked to Kr3pto targeting victims via SMS messaging over 31 days in Q1 2021.

Ex-Robotos is a phishing kit that essentially sets a benchmark when it comes to corporate credential phishing. According to data from the Akamai Intelligent Edge Platform, there were more than 220,000 hits to the API IP address used for Ex-Robotos over a span for 43 days. In fact, traffic to that address reached a peak of tens of thousands of hits per day on average between January 31 and February 5, 2021.

"Kits like Kr3pto and Ex-Robotos are just two of the many kits targeting corporations and consumers today," said Jake Sloane, Senior Threat Hunter at WMC Global. "It's important to remember that employees are consumers too, and with the prevalence of work from home, as well as mobile device usage in corporate environments, criminals are not shy about attacking people no matter where they are, which explains the recent growth in SMS-based phishing attacks."

"By partnering with WMC Global for this report, we were able to expand on our existing coverage of the financial sector and offer a wider range of details into the attacks that financial organizations face on a daily basis," added Ragan.

AKAMAI UNVEILS MACHINE LEARNING THAT INTELLIGENTLY AUTOMATES APPLICATION AND API PROTECTIONS AND REDUCES BURDEN ON SECURITY PROFESSIONALS
June 16, 2021 at 6:30 AM EDT
Edge platform enhancements increase responsiveness and augment security decision-making
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 16, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKAM), the world's most trusted solution for protecting and delivering digital experiences, today announces platform security enhancements to strengthen protection for web applications, APIs, and user accounts. Akamai's machine learning derives insight on malicious activity from more than 1.3 billion daily client interactions to intelligently automate threat detections, time-consuming tasks, and security logic to help professionals make faster, more trustworthy decisions regarding cyberthreats.

In its May 9 report Top Cybersecurity Threats in 2021, Forrester estimates that due to reasons "exacerbated by COVID-19 and the resulting growth in digital interactions, identity theft and account takeover increased by at least 10% to 15% from 2019 to 2020." The leading global research and advisory firm notes that we should "anticipate another 8% to 10% increase in identity theft and ATO [account takeover] fraud in 2021." With threat actors increasingly using automation to compromise systems and applications, security professionals must likewise automate defenses in parallel against these attacks to manage cyberthreats at pace.

New Akamai platform security enhancements include:

Adaptive Security Engine for Akamai's web application and API protection (WAAP) solutions, Kona Site Defender and Web Application Protector, is designed to automatically adapt protections with the scale and sophistication of attacks, while reducing the effort to maintain and tune policies. The Adaptive Security Engine combines proprietary anomaly risk scoring with adaptive threat profiling to identify highly targeted, evasive, and stealthy attacks. The dynamic security logic intelligently adjusts its defensive aggressiveness based on threat intelligence automatically correlated for each customer's unique traffic. Self-tuning leverages machine learning, statistical models, and heuristics to analyze all triggers across each policy to accurately differentiate between true and false positives.

Audience Hijacking Protection has been added to Akamai Page Integrity Manager to detect and block malicious activity in real time from client-side attacks using JavaScript, advertiser networks, browser plug-ins, and extensions that target web clients. Audience Hijacking Protection is designed to use machine learning to quickly identify vulnerable resources, detect suspicious behavior, and block unwanted ads, pop-ups, affiliate fraud, and other malicious activities aimed at hijacking your audience.

Bot Score and JavaScript Obfuscation have been added to Akamai Bot Manager, laying the foundation for ongoing innovations in adversarial bot management, including the ability to take action against bots aligned with corporate risk tolerance. Bot Score automatically learns unique traffic and bot patterns, and self-tunes for long-term effectiveness; JavaScript Obfuscation dynamically changes detections to prevent bot operators from reverse engineering detections.

Akamai Account Protector is a new solution designed to proactively identify and block human fraudulent activity like account takeover attacks. Using advanced machine learning, behavioral analytics, and reputation heuristics, Account Protector intelligently evaluates every login request across multiple risk and trust signals to determine if it is coming from a legitimate user or an impersonator. This capability complements Akamai's bot mitigation to provide effective protection against both malicious human actors and automated threats.

"At Akamai, our latest platform release is intended to help resolve the tension between security and ease of use, with key capabilities around automation and machine learning specifically designed to intelligently augment human decision-making," said Aparna Rayasam, senior vice president and general manager, Application Security, Akamai. "Smart automation adds immediate value and empowers users with the right tools to generate insight and context to make faster and more trustworthy decisions, seamlessly — all while anticipating what attackers might do next."
