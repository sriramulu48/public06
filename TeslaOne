AKAMAI ANNOUNCES NEW 2030 SUSTAINABILITY GOALS
April 22, 2021 at 6:25 AM EDT
100% of energy to be renewably-sourced; Net zero emissions platform
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKAM), the world's most trusted solution for protecting and delivering digital experiences, today announced new goals for its global sustainability program. The Company's five new goals, expected to be reached by 2030, are focused on three areas: the Akamai intelligent edge platform, the communities in which it lives, works and operates, and its global supply chain.

100% Renewably-sourced Energy
Akamai will prioritize implementation and procurement of purchaser-caused renewable energy with a goal to power 100% of its global operations by 2030. This includes data centers, offices, Akamai's accelerated network program partners and any source of electricity that falls under scope one and two emissions1. In the event that sufficient renewable energy supply is unavailable in the areas where Akamai has operations, the company expects to use attestable and traceable sources of renewable energy certificates to reach its goals.

Today, 50% of Akamai's energy needs is met by renewable sources. This was partially achieved through investments in net-new grid-connected renewable energy projects, including wind farms in Texas and Illinois and a solar array in Virginia.
50% More Energy-Efficient Platform
The greatest energy consumption by Akamai is the operation of its powerful edge platform, comprising approximately 325,000 servers in more than 135 countries and nearly 1,435 networks around the world. Akamai engineering teams constantly work to develop hardware and software efficiencies that help reduce power, not only for the benefit of Akamai but for its customers as well. When partnering with Akamai, customers already benefit from a reduced carbon footprint by using a shared platform versus building their own in order to meet peak capacity needs. Today, the company is announcing a new goal of operating an Akamai platform that is 50% more energy-efficient as measured against current capacity totals.
100% Platform Emissions Mitigation
Creation of a net zero Akamai edge platform requires working with data center providers and landlords to provide attestable sources of renewable power equivalent to the Akamai footprint. When this is not possible, Akamai plans to look to reduce absolute emissions through the use of credible greenhouse gas offsets offered by accredited organizations like the American Carbon Registry, Climate Action Reserve or through new and emerging capture technology. The net zero emission target applies to both its scope one and two emissions.
Responsible Supply Chain Management
Akamai expects its top suppliers to have environmental and social goals consistent with its own corporate goals. In order to facilitate this, Akamai will institute a new responsible supply chain program. The company will engage with its top suppliers to baseline and quantify scope three emissions with a goal towards a measurable reduction by 2030.
Global Expansion of 100% Electronic Waste Recycling Program
Akamai plans to continue its goal to recycle 100% of electronic waste at the end of hardware useful life, according to e-Stewards standards. Over the next 10 years, the company will look to bring efficiency to the partner program by disposing of e-waste in its country of origin where feasible. All Akamai vendors must continue to commit to protecting Akamai's customers from data breach and remain in compliance with relevant laws in their region.
"Akamai believes that corporations share the responsibility to protect the earth's natural resources," said Nicole Fitzpatrick, deputy general counsel and chief ESG officer. "These 2030 goals reflect our commitment to this belief. Moreover, Akamai realizes that being environmentally conscious is not only the right thing to do, it also makes good business sense. These five steps are designed to minimize our carbon footprint while maximizing the benefits to Akamai."

This announcement is the second phase of Akamai's sustainability program. In 2015, the company set goals to reduce its emissions by 30%, power its edge platform with 50% renewable energy, and recycle 100% of e-waste all by the end of 2020. Each of those goals was met within the established five-year period. In those five years, the available capacity of Akamai's intelligent edge platform grew by more than 350%, yet it used ten times less energy per unit of capacity than it did in 2015.

Sustainability at Akamai

Akamai strives to take a leadership role in minimizing the environmental impact of information technology systems. The company's sustainability initiatives are designed to measure and mitigate the impact of its business operations while maximizing and enhancing the benefits of sustainable business practices. Sustainable programs focus on several key areas – prioritizing the procurement and use of renewable energy to power global operations, developing operational efficiencies for Akamai's intelligent platform, implementing strategies that help reduce emissions output and mitigating up and downstream impact across the supply chain lifecycle. #GreenwithAkamai

Akamai Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act

The release contains information about future expectations, plans and prospects of Akamai's management that constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about achievement of articulated sustainability goals. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including, but not limited to, re-allocation of investment in a way that makes achievement of goals unfeasible, inability to source renewable energy on terms acceptable to us, technological barriers to efficiency initiatives, and other factors that are discussed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other documents periodically filed with the SEC.

1 The Greenhouse Gas ("GHG") Protocol Corporate Standard classifies a company's GHG emissions into three 'scopes'. Scope one emissions are direct emissions from owned or controlled sources. Scope two emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy. Scope three (The Corporate Value Chain Standard) allows companies to assess their entire value chain emissions impact and identify where to focus reduction activities. These are emissions a company is responsible for outside of its own walls—from the goods it purchases to the disposal of the products it sells.

AKAMAI UNVEILS MACHINE LEARNING THAT INTELLIGENTLY AUTOMATES APPLICATION AND API PROTECTIONS AND REDUCES BURDEN ON SECURITY PROFESSIONALS
June 16, 2021 at 6:30 AM EDT
Edge platform enhancements increase responsiveness and augment security decision-making
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 16, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKAM), the world's most trusted solution for protecting and delivering digital experiences, today announces platform security enhancements to strengthen protection for web applications, APIs, and user accounts. Akamai's machine learning derives insight on malicious activity from more than 1.3 billion daily client interactions to intelligently automate threat detections, time-consuming tasks, and security logic to help professionals make faster, more trustworthy decisions regarding cyberthreats.

 Akamai Technologies, Inc. logo (PRNewsfoto/Akamai Technologies, Inc.) 

In its May 9 report Top Cybersecurity Threats in 2021, Forrester estimates that due to reasons "exacerbated by COVID-19 and the resulting growth in digital interactions, identity theft and account takeover increased by at least 10% to 15% from 2019 to 2020." The leading global research and advisory firm notes that we should "anticipate another 8% to 10% increase in identity theft and ATO [account takeover] fraud in 2021." With threat actors increasingly using automation to compromise systems and applications, security professionals must likewise automate defenses in parallel against these attacks to manage cyberthreats at pace.

New Akamai platform security enhancements include:

Adaptive Security Engine for Akamai's web application and API protection (WAAP) solutions, Kona Site Defender and Web Application Protector, is designed to automatically adapt protections with the scale and sophistication of attacks, while reducing the effort to maintain and tune policies. The Adaptive Security Engine combines proprietary anomaly risk scoring with adaptive threat profiling to identify highly targeted, evasive, and stealthy attacks. The dynamic security logic intelligently adjusts its defensive aggressiveness based on threat intelligence automatically correlated for each customer's unique traffic. Self-tuning leverages machine learning, statistical models, and heuristics to analyze all triggers across each policy to accurately differentiate between true and false positives.

Audience Hijacking Protection has been added to Akamai Page Integrity Manager to detect and block malicious activity in real time from client-side attacks using JavaScript, advertiser networks, browser plug-ins, and extensions that target web clients. Audience Hijacking Protection is designed to use machine learning to quickly identify vulnerable resources, detect suspicious behavior, and block unwanted ads, pop-ups, affiliate fraud, and other malicious activities aimed at hijacking your audience.

Bot Score and JavaScript Obfuscation have been added to Akamai Bot Manager, laying the foundation for ongoing innovations in adversarial bot management, including the ability to take action against bots aligned with corporate risk tolerance. Bot Score automatically learns unique traffic and bot patterns, and self-tunes for long-term effectiveness; JavaScript Obfuscation dynamically changes detections to prevent bot operators from reverse engineering detections.

Akamai Account Protector is a new solution designed to proactively identify and block human fraudulent activity like account takeover attacks. Using advanced machine learning, behavioral analytics, and reputation heuristics, Account Protector intelligently evaluates every login request across multiple risk and trust signals to determine if it is coming from a legitimate user or an impersonator. This capability complements Akamai's bot mitigation to provide effective protection against both malicious human actors and automated threats.

"At Akamai, our latest platform release is intended to help resolve the tension between security and ease of use, with key capabilities around automation and machine learning specifically designed to intelligently augment human decision-making," said Aparna Rayasam, senior vice president and general manager, Application Security, Akamai. "Smart automation adds immediate value and empowers users with the right tools to generate insight and context to make faster and more trustworthy decisions, seamlessly — all while anticipating what attackers might do next."
